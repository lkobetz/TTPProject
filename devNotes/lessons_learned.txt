-can store logged in user in express sessions on the backend and sessionStore on the client side (but causes memory leak in production, see issues)
-can use a proxy (development mode) to add another server along with 'concurrently' and 'npm-run-all' to run both at once
-req.query is for get requests, req.body is for posts and puts
-npm run build is the create-react-app command that bundles react for production (change 'public' to 'build' in express static middleware)
-sequelize associations must be imported into the seed file to allow eager loading of associated data
-to seed (or re-seed) heroku database, run 'heroku run bash --app larissa-ttp-project' in bash, then 'npm run seed'
-can save cookies client-side with document.cookie = "key=value", can access them server-side in express with cookie parser and req.cookies. Can set cookies in express with res.cookie('key', 'value', {options: optional}). Can remove cookie with res.clearCookie('key')
-session.destroy() needs to be in a post route or it doesn't modify the database
-props.location.pathname comes from BrowserRouter
